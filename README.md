Project Title: Shape Based Game


Technologies:- 
            Java concepts such as class, Object, Constructor, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Upcasting, Method Overriding, HAS-A Relationship, Interface


Description:-
           I designed and implemented an engaging educational game tailored for students in classes 6 to 12th, aimed at enhancing their understanding of 2D and 3D shapes. The game features 
           a user interface where students can interact with various shapes by clicking on them. It uses object-oriented programming principles, I incorporated key concepts such as has-a- 
           relationship, method overriding, method overloading, constructor overriding, inheritance, and upcasting to create a robust and extensible codebase.
